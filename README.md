# Receipts.US

Currently a work in progress for the Springboard Software Engineering Intensive. 

Receipts.US will be a data visualization app that will be able to search for political candidates that have run for office over time, and then be able to display the contributions that have been made to their camaigns by various individuals or organizations. 

This app will use React.js for the front-end and Node.js and Express.js for the back end. The data is sourced from the OpenFEC API provided by the American Federal Election Commission.
